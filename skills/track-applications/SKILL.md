name: track-applications
description: Track the user's job applications and prepare for interviews with NeverApply. Use when the user asks about application status, what waits for them, follow-ups, quiet or stale applications, a resume tailored to a job, or interview preparation.
---

To track applications:

1. Call `list_applications`. Use `status` to narrow the list when the user asks for one group: `needs_answer` or `ready_to_send` for what waits for the user, `stale` for applications with no recent activity, or `interview` and `offer`.
2. Summarize `record` first in one or two lines: how many applications were sent, how many are not confirmed, how many wait for the user, and how many were not sent. Then list the rows that matter for the question.
3. For one application, call `get_application` with its `application_id` or `run_id`, and tell the user its `next_action`. For a held application, use the apply-to-jobs skill.

To prepare documents for a job:

- Tailored resume: call `tailor_resume` once with the active `listing_id`. Each call creates a new resume variant, so do not call it again unless the user asks. Give the user the `studio_url`, and the score change when the result has one.
- Interview preparation: call `prepare_interview` with the `application_id`, or with the `listing_id` for a job without an application. Summarize the sections that are useful now.

Both tools need a paid NeverApply plan. If a tool reports `upgrade_required`, tell the user it is a paid feature. Do not retry.

Call `send_feedback` only when the user asks to report a problem or send feedback, and use the user's own words.
